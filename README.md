This is a repository for my ongoing work on demonstrating the spectral separability of Giant Kelp and Bull Kelp in AVIRIS imagery.  This research will be submitted soon to the Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, under the title "Using AVIRIS and Machine Learning to Map and Discriminate Bull Kelp and Giant Kelp along the Pacific Coast of the United States", by the authors T. Thompson, R. Jensen, R. Kudela, and J. Bausell.
